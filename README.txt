Bad Player MOD by Maikerumine

Adds 30 "players" to your world that all have unique attributes, strengths, and rewards.  Quite fun!

Borrowed simpleskins for textures and the player model for player object.
Used a modified version of Mobs Redo code both api and init files, the mobs now wont get stuck and actually chase you now.
